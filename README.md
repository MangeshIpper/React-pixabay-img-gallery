  ## 1. Objective <a id=section1></a>

In this react project I have used JSX to build pixabay image gallery application. I have used default pixabay API to fetch data along with initial rendering used useEffect hook and stored in array used useState hooks of react library. Moreover, applyed map function on array and create grid view in the page, applied css to look attractive on hover of image opacity added to recognize image selected with pointer on. On click of any image navigate to new page with particular image information, implemented routing, created new page to show selected image and its information. Implemented responsive view for mobile, tablet, and desktop screen. Added fixed topbar with logo and user image.
